Ques 1
Ans - Here are some of the features of HTML5.

1.  Video and Audio Supporting : HTML5 introduced native support for embedding videos and audio without the need for third-party plugins like Flash.

2. Semantic Elements : HTML5 introduced new semantic elements such as <header>, <footer>, <nav>, and more, which provide a clearer structure and meaning to web documents.

3. Canvas : The <canvas> element allows for dynamic, scriptable rendering of 2D shapes and bitmap images. It is commonly used for creating interactive graphics and animations.

4. Improved Forms : HTML5 introduced new form input types (e.g., email, date, range), form validation, and enhancements like placeholder text and pattern attributes.

5. Geolocation : HTML5 provides a built-in API for accessing the user's geolocation information, enabling websites to offer location-based services.

6. Offline Web Applications : HTML5 introduced the Application Cache and Local Storage features, allowing web applications to work offline and store data locally for improved user experience.

7. Drag and Drop : HTML5 added support for easily implementing drag and drop functionality within web applications without requiring external libraries or scripts.

These are just a few of the many features that HTML5 offers. HTML5 is a versatile and powerful markup language that continues to evolve and enhance web development.


Ques 2
Ans - HTML entities are special characters or symbols that are represented using a special code or entity reference in HTML. They are used to display characters that have special meanings in HTML markup, such as angle brackets (< and >), ampersands (&), or non-breaking spaces.

Here are five commonly used HTML entities:

1.  < - Represents the less than symbol (<).
2.  \> - Represents the greater than symbol (>).
3.  & - Represents the ampersand symbol (&).
4.  " - Represents the double quotation mark (").
5. &nbsp - Represents a non-breaking space.

These entities are used to ensure that these special characters or symbols are displayed correctly in HTML, rather than being interpreted as part of the markup.
